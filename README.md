Overview:
The Cat and Dog Classification Using SVM with Synthetic Data project focuses on developing a machine learning model to accurately classify images of cats and dogs based on their
physical characteristics. Utilizing a synthetic dataset, this project simulates a realistic classification scenario by generating features—Weight, Height, and Length—representing 
the two animal classes.The classification process employs the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, a powerful supervised learning technique that constructs hyperplanes in a
high-dimensional space to separate different classes. In this implementation, a linear kernel is used to effectively discern between cats and dogs based on the generated features.
This project serves not only as an educational tool for understanding machine learning principles but also as a foundation for more complex classification tasks. 

Key Features:
>>Synthetic Dataset Generation**: Creates a dataset with features representing cats and dogs, allowing for controlled experiments.
>>Data Preprocessing**: Standardizes features to ensure consistent scaling and improve model performance, which is crucial for algorithms like SVM.
>>Model Training**: Utilizes the SVM algorithm to train the model on the training dataset.
>>Model Evaluation**: Assesses performance using a confusion matrix and classification report, providing insights into accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
>>Visualization**: Displays classification results through a scatter plot, allowing for visual interpretation of model performance.
